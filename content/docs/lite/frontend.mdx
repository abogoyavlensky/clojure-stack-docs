## Tailwind CSS setup

For CSS styling we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). We use simplest way to install it, using CLI tool

```shell
mise install tailwindcss
```
Minimal configuration is in `resources/public/css/input.css` file. You can add your own configuration there.

```css title="resources/public/css/input.css"
@import 'tailwindcss' source("../../../src");
```

It detects all changes in the `src` folder and rebuilds CSS file.

There are two commands to run tailwindcss:

1. `bb css-watch` - watch for changes in CSS files and recompile them. It is used for development.
2. `bb css-build` - build CSS file once, it is used for production.

By default, application system uses `bb css-watch` command to compile CSS files. You can add/change any CSS class in Hiccup in any file of the project
and after refreshing the page you will see changes in the browser.


The command `bb css-watch` starts automiatically **only** in development mode:

```clojure title="resources/config.dev.edn"
#merge [#include "config.edn"
        {:integrant-extras.process/process {:cmd ["bb" "css-watch"]
                                            :opts {:err :inherit}}}]
```

It starts `bb css-watch` command in the background and you can see the output in the terminal only about first run.
If you want to see all output of the command  about each rebuild, you can add `:opts {:err :inherit}` to the process config:

```clojure title="resources/config.dev.edn"
#merge [#include "config.edn"
        {:integrant-extras.process/process {:cmd ["bb" "css-watch"]
                                            // [!code highlight]
                                            :opts {:err :inherit}}}]
```


If you don't want to start `bb css-watch` command automatically with the dev system you remove config file parameter from `read-config` function:

```clojure title="dev/user.clj"
;...
(defn reset
  "Restart system."
  []
  (ig-repl/set-prep! #(ig-extras/read-config :dev))
  (ig-repl/reset))
;...
```

And the run on you own `bb css-watch` command in the terminal.
