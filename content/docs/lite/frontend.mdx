## POST requests

Server includes `wrap-anti-forgery` middleware by default. It is used to protect your application from CSRF attacks.
This means all POST requests should include a CSRF-token in the request body.
There are two ways to include a CSRF-token:

1. Hidden input field in the form:

```clojure title="src/myproject/views.clj"
(ns myproject.views
  (:require ;...
            // [!code highlight]
            [reitit-extras.core :as reitit-extras]))

[:form
  // [!code highlight]
  (reitit-extras/csrf-token-html)
  ;...
  ]
```

2. Header in the request:

```clojure title="src/myproject/views.clj"
; ...
[:button
 {:hx-delete "/api/delete"
  // [!code highlight]
  :hx-headers (reitit-extras/csrf-token-json)}
 "Delete"]
```


## Tailwind CSS setup

For CSS styling, we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). We use the simplest installation method via the CLI tool:

```shell
mise install tailwindcss
```

Minimal configuration is in the `resources/public/css/input.css` file where you can add your own configuration:

```css title="resources/public/css/input.css"
@import 'tailwindcss' source("../../../src");
```

This detects all changes in the `src` folder and rebuilds the CSS file.

There are two commands to run Tailwind CSS:

1. `bb css-watch` - watches for changes in CSS files and recompiles them. Used for development.
2. `bb css-build` - builds CSS files once. Used for production.

By default, the application system uses `bb css-watch` to compile CSS files.
Both commands create a `resources/public/css/output.css` file with compiled CSS.
You can add or change any CSS class in Hiccup in any project file, and after refreshing the page, you'll see the changes in the browser.

The `bb css-watch` command starts automatically **only** in development mode:

```clojure title="resources/config.dev.edn"
#merge [#include "config.edn"
        {:integrant-extras.process/process {:cmd ["bb" "css-watch"]
                                            :opts {:err :inherit}}}]
```

It runs the `bb css-watch` command in the background. By default, you'll only see output about the first run.
If you want to see complete output about each rebuild, you can add `:opts {:err :inherit}` to the process config:

```clojure title="resources/config.dev.edn"
#merge [#include "config.edn"
        {:integrant-extras.process/process {:cmd ["bb" "css-watch"]
                                            // [!code highlight]
                                            :opts {:err :inherit}}}]
```

If you don't want to start the `bb css-watch` command automatically with the dev system, you can remove the dev config file parameter from the `read-config` function:

```clojure title="dev/user.clj"
;...
(defn reset
  "Restart system."
  []
  (ig-repl/set-prep! #(ig-extras/read-config :dev))
  (ig-repl/reset))
;...
```

Then run `bb css-watch` in the terminal yourself.

## Static assets management

The template has an extremely lightweight static assets management approach. The idea is to vendor all assets in the `resources/public` folder except the output CSS file.

### Fetching assets

By default, two JS libraries are included in the template: `resources/public/alpine.min.js` and `resources/public/htmx.min.js`.
Their versions are specified in the `bb.edn` file under the `fetch-assets` command:

```clojure
{:tasks
 {;...
  fetch-assets {:doc "Fetch static file assets from URLs"
                :requires ([manifest-edn.core :as manifest])
                :task (manifest/fetch-assets!
                        // [!code highlight]
                        [{:url "https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4/dist/htmx.min.js"
                          :filepath "js/htmx.min.js"}
                         // [!code highlight]
                         {:url "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.14.8/dist/cdn.min.js"
                          :filepath "js/alpinejs.min.js"}])}
```

The small library [`manifest-edn`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/manifest-edn) is used to fetch assets from URLs and save them in the `resources/public` folder according to the `:filepath`.
You can add your own assets to the `resources/public` folder. For example, let's add the [`response-targets`]() extension to HTMX:

```clojure
{:tasks
 {;...
  fetch-assets {;...
                :task (manifest/fetch-assets!
                        // [!code highlight]
                        [;...
                         // [!code highlight]
                         {:url "https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-response-targets@2.0.2"
                          :filepath "js/htmx-ext-response-targets.min.js"}])}
```

After running `bb fetch-assets`, a new JS file `resources/public/js/htmx-ext-response-targets.min.js` will be added.

### Use assets in HTML

To use any asset in our HTML, wrap it with the `asset` function:

```clojure title="src/myproject/views.clj"
(ns myproject.views
  (:require ;...
            [manifest-edn.core :as manifest]))

(defn base
  "Base component for html page."
  [content]
  [:html
   [:head
    [:link {:rel "icon"
            // [!code highlight]
            :href (manifest/asset "images/icon.svg")
            :type "image/svg+xml"}]
    [:link {:type "text/css"
            :href (manifest/asset "css/output.css")
            :rel "stylesheet"}]]
   [:body
    ;...
    [:script {:type "text/javascript"
              // [!code highlight]
              :src (manifest/asset "js/htmx.min.js")
              :defer true}]
    [:script {:type "text/javascript"
              // [!code highlight]
              :src (manifest/asset "js/htmx-ext-response-targets.min.js")
              :defer true}]
    [:script {:type "text/javascript"
              // [!code highlight]
              :src (manifest/asset "js/alpinejs.min.js")
              :defer true}]]])
```

This applies to all assets from the `resources/public` folder. For example, the image `images/icon.svg` is also wrapped with the `asset` function.
In development, this function adds the prefix `/assets` to the path, making it available at `http://localhost:3000/assets/images/icon.svg`.
In production, before building the jar file, `(manifest/hash-assets!)` runs to hash all assets from the public directory and add a `manifest.edn` file with all assets and their hashes.
The `manifest/asset` function uses this hash to generate the path to the asset.

## PWA support

The template has basic Progressive Web Application (PWA) support. It includes a manifest file but doesn't include a service worker. You can add your own service worker if needed.
The manifest file is located at `resources/public/manifest.json` and defines the PWA properties.
By default, there's an optimized set of icons for the PWA, following the recommendations from this excellent [favicon guide](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs).

Before going to production, change the name, URL, and ID of the app in the manifest file. You'll also likely want to replace the icons in `resources/public/images` with your own.
