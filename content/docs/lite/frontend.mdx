## POST requests

The server includes `wrap-anti-forgery` middleware by default to protect your application from CSRF attacks.
This security measure requires all POST requests to include a CSRF token in the request body.
You can include a CSRF token in two ways:

1. Hidden input field in the form:

```clojure title="src/myproject/views.clj"
(ns myproject.views
  (:require ;...
            // [!code highlight]
            [reitit-extras.core :as reitit-extras]))

[:form
  // [!code highlight]
  (reitit-extras/csrf-token-html)
  ;...
  ]
```

2. Header in the request:

```clojure title="src/myproject/views.clj"
; ...
[:button
 {:hx-delete "/api/delete"
  // [!code highlight]
  :hx-headers (reitit-extras/csrf-token-json)}
 "Delete"]
```


## Tailwind CSS setup

For CSS styling, Clojure Stack Lite uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) with the simplest installation method via the CLI tool:

```shell
mise install tailwindcss
```

The minimal configuration is in the `resources/public/css/input.css` file where you can add your own customizations:

```css title="resources/public/css/input.css"
@import 'tailwindcss' source("../../../src");
```

This configuration detects all changes in the `src` folder and automatically rebuilds the CSS file.

There are two commands available for working with Tailwind CSS:

1. `bb css-watch` - watches for changes in CSS files and recompiles them in real-time (for development)
2. `bb css-build` - builds CSS files once (for production)

By default, the application system uses `bb css-watch` to compile CSS files.
Both commands generate a `resources/public/css/output.css` file with compiled CSS.
You can add or modify any CSS class in Hiccup in any project file, and after refreshing the page, you'll immediately see the changes in the browser.

The `bb css-watch` command starts automatically **only** in development mode:

```clojure title="resources/config.dev.edn"
#merge [#include "config.edn"
        {:integrant-extras.process/process {:cmd ["bb" "css-watch"]
                                            :opts {:err :inherit}}}]
```

This runs the `bb css-watch` command in the background. By default, you'll only see output about the first run.
If you want to see complete output for each rebuild, you can add `:opts {:err :inherit}` to the process config:

```clojure title="resources/config.dev.edn"
#merge [#include "config.edn"
        {:integrant-extras.process/process {:cmd ["bb" "css-watch"]
                                            // [!code highlight]
                                            :opts {:err :inherit}}}]
```

If you prefer not to start the `bb css-watch` command automatically with the dev system, you can remove the dev config file parameter from the `read-config` function:

```clojure title="dev/user.clj"
;...
(defn reset
  "Restart system."
  []
  (ig-repl/set-prep! #(ig-extras/read-config :dev))
  (ig-repl/reset))
;...
```

Then you can run `bb css-watch` manually in your terminal.

## Static assets management

The template implements a lightweight static assets management approach. The core concept is to vendor all assets in the `resources/public` folder except the output CSS file.

### Fetching assets

By default, two JavaScript libraries are included in the template: `resources/public/alpine.min.js` and `resources/public/htmx.min.js`.
Their versions are specified in the `bb.edn` file under the `fetch-assets` command:

```clojure
{:tasks
 {;...
  fetch-assets {:doc "Fetch static file assets from URLs"
                :requires ([manifest-edn.core :as manifest])
                :task (manifest/fetch-assets!
                        // [!code highlight]
                        [{:url "https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4/dist/htmx.min.js"
                          :filepath "js/htmx.min.js"}
                         // [!code highlight]
                         {:url "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.14.8/dist/cdn.min.js"
                          :filepath "js/alpinejs.min.js"}])}
```

The lightweight [`manifest-edn`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/manifest-edn) library is used to fetch assets from URLs and save them in the `resources/public` folder according to the specified `:filepath`.
You can easily add your own assets to the `resources/public` folder. For example, to add the [`response-targets`](https://htmx.org/extensions/response-targets/) extension for HTMX:

```clojure
{:tasks
 {;...
  fetch-assets {;...
                :task (manifest/fetch-assets!
                        // [!code highlight]
                        [;...
                         // [!code highlight]
                         {:url "https://unpkg.com/htmx-ext-response-targets@2.0.2"
                          :filepath "js/htmx-ext-response-targets.min.js"}])}
```

After running `bb fetch-assets`, a new JS file `resources/public/js/htmx-ext-response-targets.min.js` will be added to your project.

### Use assets in HTML

To use any asset in your HTML, simply wrap it with the `asset` function:

```clojure title="src/myproject/views.clj"
(ns myproject.views
  (:require ;...
            [manifest-edn.core :as manifest]))

(defn base
  "Base component for html page."
  [content]
  [:html
   [:head
    [:link {:rel "icon"
            // [!code highlight]
            :href (manifest/asset "images/icon.svg")
            :type "image/svg+xml"}]
    [:link {:type "text/css"
            :href (manifest/asset "css/output.css")
            :rel "stylesheet"}]]
   [:body
    ;...
    [:script {:type "text/javascript"
              // [!code highlight]
              :src (manifest/asset "js/htmx.min.js")
              :defer true}]
    [:script {:type "text/javascript"
              // [!code highlight]
              :src (manifest/asset "js/htmx-ext-response-targets.min.js")
              :defer true}]
    [:script {:type "text/javascript"
              // [!code highlight]
              :src (manifest/asset "js/alpinejs.min.js")
              :defer true}]]])
```

This approach applies to all assets in the `resources/public` folder. For example, the image `images/icon.svg` is also wrapped with the `asset` function.
In development, this function adds the prefix `/assets` to the path, making it available at `http://localhost:3000/assets/images/icon.svg`.
In production, before building the jar file, `(manifest/hash-assets!)` runs to hash all assets from the public directory and add a `manifest.edn` file with all assets and their hashes.
The `manifest/asset` function uses this hash to generate the path to the asset, enabling efficient caching and versioning.

## PWA support

The template includes basic Progressive Web Application (PWA) support. It provides a manifest file but does not include a service worker by default. You can add your own service worker if needed for your application requirements.

The manifest file is located at `resources/public/manifest.json` and defines the PWA properties.
By default, there's an optimized set of icons for the PWA, following the recommendations from this excellent [favicon guide](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs).

Before deploying to production, remember to update the name, URL, and ID of the app in the manifest file. You'll also likely want to replace the default icons in `resources/public/images` with your own branded assets.
