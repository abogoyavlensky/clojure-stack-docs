## Deploying to Fly.io from local machine

Assuming you have created your application using the option `:deploy :none`, you can deploy it to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) using the following steps:

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add `flyctl` system dependency

Add `flyctl` to `.mise.toml` file with the latest version at the moment (or install manually):

```toml title=".mise.toml"
[tools]
...
// [!code highlight]
flyctl = "0.3.112"

[alias]
...
```

Then run `mise install`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Create a new Fly.io configuration

Run the following command to create a new Fly.io configuration:

```shell
flyctl auth login
flyctl launch --no-deploy
```

The command will create `fly.toml` file in the root of your project. You can edit it to set the desired configuration.

#### SQLite
If you use SQLite, you need to add a volume to the `fly.toml` file:

```toml title="fly.toml"
...
// [!code highlight]
[mounts]
  // [!code highlight]
  source = "your-unique-volume-name"
  // [!code highlight]
  destination = "/app/db"
  // [!code highlight]
  initial_size = 1
```

#### PostgreSQL

For PostgreSQL you have multiple options:

- Use [Managed PostgreSQL](https://fly.io/docs/mpg/overview/) from Fly.io
- Run PostgreSQL as a regular service on Fly.io
- Use any other managed PostgreSQL service, such as [Neon](https://neon.tech/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), etc.
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy your application

Run the following command to deploy your application:

```shell
flyctl deploy
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying to Fly.io from Github Actions

<Steps>
<Step>
### Generate access token

Generate a new access token in your [Fly.io account settings](https://fly.io/docs/security/tokens/) and add it to your repository secrets as `FLY_API_TOKEN`.
</Step>

<Step>
Add following `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml"
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  checks:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/checks.yaml

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20
    needs: [ checks ]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: jdx/mise-action@v2
        with:
          install_args: "flyctl"

      - name: Build and deploy
        env:
          FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
        run: flyctl deploy --remote-only
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy your application from GitHub Actions

Push your changes to the `master` branch and the deployment will be triggered automatically.
