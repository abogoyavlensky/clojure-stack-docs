## Editor setup

### IntelliJ IDEA with Cursive

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA with the Cursive plugin. It will automatically detect the project structure and dependencies and configure the REPL run configuration. We need to slightly update it with additional aliases for `dev` and `test`:

1. At the top right corner, open `REPL for myproject` -> `Edit Configurations...`

2. Add options `-A:user:dev:test` and press `OK`:

![Clojure Stack Lite](@/public/lite_idea_aliases.png)

3. Now you can run the REPL, execute `(reset)` in it, and start coding.

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
    It is convenient to configure the REPL command and bind it to a keyboard shortcut so you can quickly run `(reset)` with a keypress.
</Callout>

### VSCode with Calva

Open the project in VSCode with the Calva extension. It will automatically detect the project structure.

1. Start the REPL by running "Calva: Start a Project REPL and Connect (aka Jack-In)":

![Clojure Stack Lite](@/public/lite_calva_start_repl.png)

2. Select `deps.edn` configuration in the popup:

![Clojure Stack Lite](@/public/lite_calva_deps.png)

3. Select `dev` and `test` aliases in the next popup:

![Clojure Stack Lite](@/public/lite_calva_aliases.png)

Now you have the REPL running and can execute `(reset)` to start the application. To do this, navigate to the `dev/user.clj` file:

![Clojure Stack Lite](@/public/lite_calva_user_clj.png)

and run the command "Calva: Evaluate Current Form":

![Clojure Stack Lite](@/public/lite_calva_run_current_form.png)

The system will start in the REPL:

## REPL

The REPL is the main entry point for development. You can run it from the terminal or from your IDE as shown in the previous section.
We have preconfigured some convenient commands for you in the `dev/user.clj` file in the `(comment ...)` section at the bottom.

Let's look at them:

1. `(reset)` - starts the application and automatically reloads it on code changes.
2. `(stop)` - stops the application.
3. `(run-all-tests)` - runs all tests in the project.
4. `(repl-deps/sync-deps)` - fetches new dependencies from `deps.edn` and loads them into the REPL.

## mise

This project template uses [`mise-en-place`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage system dependencies. It's a convenient tool for managing isolated environments for different projects.
All system dependency versions are specified in the `.mise.toml` file. Install them by running:

```shell
mise install
```

This will install all required system dependencies for the project. The first time, you might also need to run `mise trust`.

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">This tool is entirely optional. You can install all required tools manually if you prefer. Just consult the `.mise.toml` file for specific versions.</Callout>

## Manage project

We use Babashka Tasks for managing the project. View the list of available tasks by executing `bb tasks` in the terminal:

```shell
The following tasks are available:

deps           Install all dev deps
clj-repl       Run built-in Clojure REPL
fmt-check      Check code formatting
fmt            Fix code formatting
lint-init      Linting project's classpath
lint           Linting project's code
outdated-check Check outdated Clojure deps versions
outdated       Upgrade outdated Clojure deps versions
test           Run tests
check          Run all code checks and tests
css-watch      Rebuild css on file change in watch mode
css-build      Build minified css
fetch-assets   Fetch static file assets from URLs
build          Build application uberjar
kamal          Deploy application using Kamal
```

To lint, format code, check all dependency versions, and run tests, use the `bb check` command, or run other commands individually.

There are two commands to manage CSS files: `css-watch` and `css-build`. You don't need to run them manually because the watch-command is already included in the system start in the `resources/config.dev.edn` file, and the build-command is used in the Dockerfile for production builds.

The project includes a minimal build tool for static files called `fetch-assets` that downloads files from URLs and places them in the `resources/public` directory. This helps vendor all static files in the project.
To configure which files to download, edit the `bb.edn` file in the fetch-assets task definition:

```clojure
fetch-assets {:doc "Fetch static file assets from URLs"
                :requires ([manifest-edn.core :as manifest])
                :task (manifest/fetch-assets!
                        // [!code highlight]
                        [{:url "https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.4/dist/htmx.min.js"
                          // [!code highlight]
                          :filepath "js/htmx.min.js"}
                         {:url "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.14.8/dist/cdn.min.js"
                          :filepath "js/alpinejs.min.js"}])}
```

## Pre-commit git hooks

Running code quality checks before committing or pushing code is convenient. The project intentionally doesn't include this by default as everyone has their own preferences.
However, you can easily add it using the excellent tool [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook):

1. Install Lefthook by adding it to the `.mise.toml` file and running `mise install`:

```toml title=".mise.toml"
lefthook = "1.8.2"
```

2. Create a `.lefthook.yml` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```yaml
pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    fmt:
      glob: "*.{clj,edn}"
      run: bb fmt-check
    lint:
      glob: "*.{clj,edn}"
      run: bb lint
```

3. Activate Lefthook by running:

```shell
lefthook install
```

Before your next commit, Lefthook will run the `bb fmt-check` and `bb lint` commands if any Clojure or EDN files have been changed.

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">If you prefer, you can change `pre-commit` to `pre-push`, or add `bb test` and `bb outdate` commands to the config.</Callout>
