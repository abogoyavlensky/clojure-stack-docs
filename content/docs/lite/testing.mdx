As a test runner we use minimalistic `eftest/eftest` runner. It's very close to `clojure.test` but has a few improvements for showing the results in a more readable way.
There is a pre-configured testing coverage using `cloverage/cloverage`. The coverage report is generated in `target/coverage` directory.

Tests are in the `test/myproject` directory. You can run them with the following command:

```bash
bb test
```

`test/myproject/test_utils.clj` contains a few utility functions that are used in the tests for managing CSRF-token and cookies, and for cleaning up the database between tests.

For integration tests we start the system using existing fixture from `integrant-extras` library:

```clojure
(ns myproject.home-test
  (:require ;...
            [reitit-extras.tests :as reitit-extras]))

(use-fixtures :once
  (ig-extras/with-system))

;...
```

Then in your tests you can have an access the system components via `reitit-extras.tests/*test-system*` dynamic variable. It contains the system map with all the components started with the `:test` profile.
The real server and database are started, so you can test the whole stack. The database is cleaned up between tests.

For integration testing we have `org.clj-commons/hickory` library that parses HTML and provides a nice API for querying the DOM.
