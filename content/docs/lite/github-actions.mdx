description: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Github Actions
---

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

1. **Code Quality Checks** - Validates code quality and runs tests
2. **Custom Action** - Defines reusable workflow components for cashing Clojure dependencies
3. **Deployment** - Handles the deployment process to various environments

## Workflow Details

### Code Quality Checks (`checks.yaml`)

This workflow runs whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created, ensuring code quality standards are maintained.
It triggers linting, formatting, testing and checking for stale dependencies.

### 3. Deployment (`deploy.yaml`)

This workflow handles the deployment process to production.
It builds the Docker image tagged by git commit sha, pushes it to the registry, and deploys it to the production environment.
