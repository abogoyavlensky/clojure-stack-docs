description: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions
---

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows that automate your development process from code changes to production deployment:

1. **Code Quality Checks** - Validates code quality and runs tests
2. **Custom Action** - Defines reusable workflow components for caching Clojure dependencies
3. **Deployment** - Handles the deployment process to various environments

Automating these processes ensures consistent quality, reduces manual errors, and speeds up your development cycle.

## Workflow Details

### Code Quality Checks (`.github/workflows/checks.yaml`)

This workflow runs whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created, ensuring code quality standards are maintained.
It triggers linting, formatting, testing and checking for stale dependencies. This helps catch issues early in the development process.

### Custom Action (`.github/workflows/clojure-deps-action.yaml`)

This reusable workflow component optimizes CI/CD performance by efficiently caching Clojure dependencies.
It reduces build times by avoiding redundant downloads of the same dependencies across workflow runs.

### Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`)

This workflow handles the deployment process to production.
It builds the Docker image tagged by git commit SHA, pushes it to the registry, and deploys it to the production environment.
The automated deployment process ensures consistent and reliable releases with minimal manual intervention.


<Callout title="Tip" type="warn">
To deploy to production, you need to add required environment variables to the `Actions secrets and variables` page of your project repository.
More details can be found in the [Deployment](/docs/lite/kamal#deploy-from-github-actions) section of the documentation.
