description: Deploy your Clojure application with Kamal
---

We use [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) for deployment. It's a CLI tool that simplifies deployment with Docker on your own server.

## Install Kamal locally

Add `ruby = "3.3.0"` to your project's `.mise.toml` or to the global `~/.mise.toml` file.

Install Ruby and Kamal:

```shell
brew install libyaml  # or for Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev`
mise install ruby
gem install kamal -v 2.5.3
```

## Deploy from local machine using Kamal

Create a `.env` file with appropriate variables for your project:

```bash
SERVER_IP=192.168.0.1
REGISTRY_USERNAME=your-github-username
REGISTRY_PASSWORD=personal-github-token
APP_DOMAIN=app.domain.com
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=secret-key
```

### First deploy to a fresh server:

```shell
bb kamal setup
```

If you already have a server with Kamal installed, you can skip this step.

### Regular deployment

```shell
bb kamal deploy
```

## Deploy from GitHub Actions

Setup secrets for Actions:

```shell
SERVER_IP=192.168.0.1
APP_DOMAIN=app.domain.com
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=secret-ssh-key
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=secret-key
```

### Notes

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - a new SSH private key **without password** that you created and added the public part to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to authorize from the CI worker.

To generate SSH keys, run:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
