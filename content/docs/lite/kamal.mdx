description: Deploy your Clojure application with Kamal
---

We use [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) for deployment. It's a CLI tool that simplifies deployment with Docker on your own server.

## Install Kamal locally

Add `ruby = "3.3.0"` to your project's `.mise.toml` or to the global `~/.mise.toml` file.

Install Ruby and Kamal:

```shell
brew install libyaml  # or for Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev`
mise install ruby
gem install kamal -v 2.5.3
```

## Deploy from local machine using Kamal

At the root directory of your project, please create a `.env` file with appropriate variables for your project:

```bash
SERVER_IP=192.168.0.1
REGISTRY_USERNAME=your-github-username
REGISTRY_PASSWORD=personal-github-token
APP_DOMAIN=app.domain.com
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=secret-key
```

- `SERVER_IP` is the IP address of your server.
- `REGISTRY_USERNAME` is your GitHub username, that we will use to push the Docker image to the GitHub registry.
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is your personal access token with `write:packages` and `read:packages` scopes. You can create it in your GitHub account settings.
- `APP_DOMAIN` is your application domain name. It will be used to generate the SSL certificate for your application and make routing at reverse proxy.
- `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` can be any random string. It will be used to sign the session cookies.

<Callout title="Important" type="warn">`.env` must not be included to the system control version of your repository.</Callout>

### SSH access to the server from CI

`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - an SSH private key **without password** that you should create and add the public part of it to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to authorize from the CI worker.

To generate SSH keys, run:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

As a result you will be able to deploy from GitHub Actions.


### Create GitHub Token

To create a personal access token, go to your GitHub account settings, navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens" > "Tokens (classic)" and click on "Generate new token". Make sure to select the `write:packages` and `read:packages` scopes.

This token you will put to `REGISTRY_USERNAME` env var **only locally**. In CI we will be using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` which is automatically created by GitHub Actions for each workflow run.

### First deploy to a fresh server

<Callout title="Important" type="watn">
    Before first deployment, please, update repository url in `LABEL` of your Dockerimage.
    This is important for correct attribution of the image and ability to push image to GitHub registry from GitHub Actions using built-in GitHub Access Token from `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` in the CI workflow file.
</Callout>

```shell
bb kamal setup
```

This first run will take some time to install Docker and other dependencies on the server.

If you already have a server with Kamal installed, you can skip this step.

<Callout title="Info" type="info">We run Kamal via Babashka task as we changed the default location for deployment config to `.kamal/deploy.yml` to keep Kamal files in single place.</Callout>

### GitHub Packages Registry

If `LABEL` in Dockerimage was set up correctly, after first deployment you will see your image in the GitHub Packages on the repository page:

### Regular deployment

```shell
bb kamal deploy
```

## Deploy from GitHub Actions

Setup secrets for Actions:

```shell
SERVER_IP=192.168.0.1
APP_DOMAIN=app.domain.com
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=secret-ssh-key
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=secret-key
```

Then you can just push to master, or merge PR to master and GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your application to the server.

Full cycle of regular deployment from GitHub Actions should take from 2 to 3 minutes.
