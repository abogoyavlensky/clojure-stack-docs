description: Optional authentication and Registration flow
---

Authentication and registration flow is available as an optional feature in the template. To enable it, you need to set the `:auth true` option when creating your project.

```shell
clojure -Tnew create :template io.github.abogoyavlensky/clojure-stack-lite :name myproject :auth true
```

# Authentication & Registration System

The Clojure Stack Lite includes a complete authentication and registration system built with a streamlined user experience.

## Overview

The authentication system provides a full-featured user management solution including registration, login, logout, password reset, password change, and account management. It uses session-based authentication with CSRF protection and implements secure password handling using industry-standard algorithms.

## Core Libraries

- Buddy Authentication (`buddy/buddy-auth`, `buddy/buddy-hashers`, `buddy/buddy-sign`)
  - Session-based authentication backend
  - BCrypt+SHA512 password hashing 
  - JWT token signing for password reset flows
- Reitit - HTTP routing with middleware composition
- Malli - Schema validation for form inputs
- HoneySQL - SQL query building

## Features

### 1. User Registration

- Email validation with regex pattern matching
- Password requirements (minimum 8 characters)
- Unique email constraint enforcement
- Automatic password hashing on creation
- Immediate login after successful registration

### 2. User Login/Logout

- Email and password authentication
- Session management with identity storage
- Secure password verification with error handling
- HTMX-powered redirect responses

### 3. Password Reset Flow

- Email-triggered password reset requests
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration 
- Secure token validation and verification
- Console-based email simulation (production-ready for SMTP integration)

### 4. Account Management 

- User account page with current information
- Password change functionality
- Current password verification
- Prevention of password reuse
- Password confirmation validation


## Route Structure

```clojure
[["/auth"
  ["/register" {...}]
  ["/login" {...}]
  ["/forgot-password" {...}]
  ["/reset-password" {...}]
  ["/logout" {...}]]
 ["/account"
  ["/change-password" {...}]]]
```

## Development Notes

### Email Integration

The password reset system currently prints reset links to the console. For production deployment:

1. Replace `send-email!` function in `src/myproject/auth/handlers.clj`
2. Integrate with email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
3. Configure SMTP settings in application config

### Customization Points

1. **Password Requirements**: Modify validation in `src/myproject/routes.clj`
2. **Token Expiration**: Adjust JWT expiration in `src/myproject/auth/handlers.clj`
3. **UI Styling**: Customize forms in `src/myproject/auth/views.clj`
4. **Database Schema**: Add fields via new migrations in `resources/migrations/`

### Security Considerations

- Session secrets should be environment-specific and secure
- Consider implementing rate limiting for auth endpoints
- JWT tokens are time-limited for password resets
- All password operations use constant-time comparison

This authentication system provides a solid foundation for web applications requiring user management with modern security practices and excellent user experience.
