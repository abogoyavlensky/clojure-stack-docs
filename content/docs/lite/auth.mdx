description: Optional authentication and Registration flow
---

Authentication and registration flow is available as an optional feature in the template. To enable it, you need to set the `:auth true` option when creating your project.

```shell
clojure -Tnew create :template io.github.abogoyavlensky/clojure-stack-lite :name myproject :auth true
```

# Authentication & Registration System

Th Clojure Stack Lite includes a complete authentication and registration system built with a streamlined user experience.

## Overview

The authentication system provides a full-featured user management solution including registration, login, password reset, and account management. It uses session-based authentication with CSRF protection and implements secure password handling using industry-standard algorithms.

## Core Libraries

- Buddy Authentication (buddy/buddy-auth, buddy/buddy-hashers, buddy/buddy-sign)
  - Session-based authentication backend
  - BCrypt+SHA512 password hashing 
  - JWT token signing for password reset flows
- Reitit - HTTP routing with middleware composition
- Malli - Schema validation for form inputs
- HoneySQL - SQL query building

## Features

### 1. User Registration

- Email validation with regex pattern matching
- Password requirements (minimum 8 characters)
- Unique email constraint enforcement
- Automatic password hashing on creation
- Immediate login after successful registration

### 2. User Login/Logout

- Email and password authentication
- Session management with identity storage
- Secure password verification with error handling
- HTMX-powered redirect responses

### 3. Password Reset Flow

- Email-triggered password reset requests
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration 
- Secure token validation and verification
- Console-based email simulation (production-ready for SMTP integration)

### 4. Account Management 

- User account page with current information
- Password change functionality
- Current password verification
- Prevention of password reuse
- Password confirmation validation


  Route Structure

  Public Routes (with redirect middleware)

  ["/auth"
   {:middleware [[auth-middleware/wrap-authentication auth-backend]
                 wrap-already-logged-in]}
   ["/register" {...}]
   ["/login" {...}]
   ["/forgot-password" {...}]
   ["/reset-password" {...}]]

  Protected Routes (require authentication)

  ["/account"
   {:middleware [[auth-middleware/wrap-authentication auth-backend]
                 wrap-login-required]}
   ["" {:name ::account ...}]
   ["/change-password" {...}]]

  Testing Strategy

  Comprehensive Test Coverage

  - Registration tests: Valid registration, duplicate emails, validation errors
  - Login tests: Successful auth, invalid credentials, form validation
  - Password reset tests: Token generation, validation, expiration
  - Account management tests: Password changes, validation rules

  Test Infrastructure

  - HTTP client testing with clj-http
  - HTML parsing with Hickory for form validation
  - Database state management with transaction rollbacks
  - CSRF token simulation for form submissions

  Development Notes

  Email Integration

  The password reset system currently prints reset links to the console. For production deployment:

  1. Replace send-email! function in src/myproject/auth/handlers.clj:195
  2. Integrate with email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
  3. Configure SMTP settings in application config

  Customization Points

  1. Password Requirements: Modify validation in src/myproject/routes.clj:50,88
  2. Token Expiration: Adjust JWT expiration in src/myproject/auth/handlers.clj:54
  3. UI Styling: Customize forms in src/myproject/auth/views.clj
  4. Database Schema: Add fields via new migrations in resources/migrations/

  Security Considerations

  - Session secrets should be environment-specific and secure
  - Consider implementing rate limiting for auth endpoints
  - JWT tokens are single-use for password resets
  - All password operations use constant-time comparison

  This authentication system provides a solid foundation for web applications requiring user management with modern security practices and excellent user experience.
