## Create application

1. Create project.

   Change `myproject` to name of you project and run one of two following commands.

   Using [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure):

   ```shell
   clojure -Ttools install-latest :lib io.github.seancorfield/deps-new :as new && \
   clojure -Sdeps '{:override-deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.12.0"}}}' \
        -Tnew create :template io.github.abogoyavlensky/clojure-stack-lite :name myproject
   ```

   If you already have Clojure CLI with Clojure `1.12.x` and `deps-new` tool, then you can just run:

   ```shell
   clojure -Tnew create :template io.github.abogoyavlensky/clojure-stack-lite :name myproject
   ```

   OR alternatively using [neil](https://github.com/babashka/neil):

   ```shell
   brew install babashka/brew/neil && \
   neil new io.github.abogoyavlensky/clojure-stack-lite myproject
   ```
   <Callout type="warn">
     At the moment `neil` automatically adds `:neil` alias to `deps.edn` after generating the project.
     So, for now, you might want to delete it manually.
   </Callout>

2. Start development (with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)).

   <Callout type="info">
     `mise` is just convenient tool to manage system deps in version isolation for different projects.
     If you want, you can install all required tools manually, consult `.mise.toml` for specific versions.
   </Callout>

   ```shell
   cd myproject
   mise trust && mise install
   bb clj-repl
   user=> (reset)
   ```

   The server should be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Options

<Callout type="info">At the moment there are no configuration available for the template.</Callout>


## After creating a project

After creating a project you will have a file structure and all configurations for starting development.
First thing is recommended to do is checking the code formatting, linting, tests and outdated deps.

```shell
bb check
```

Now we can initiate `git` and commit initial setup:

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -am 'Initial commit'
```

Now we can go to Github and [create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
to add it as a remote target to your local one:

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/myproject.git
```
