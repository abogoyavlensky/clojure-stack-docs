We just created a new project and ready to get started. Let's build a simple application.
We are going to build Movies app with ability to add, delete and show list of movies.

_TODO: add screenshot of the final app_

## After generating project

First thing is recommended to do is checking the code formatting, linting, tests and outdated deps.
You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your system as tests are running Testcontainers using Docker.

```shell
bb check
```

Now we can initiate `git` and commit initial setup:

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -am 'Initial commit'
```

## Start server

Navigate to project root and run REPL:

```shell
cd myproject
bb clj-repl
```

Then once we are in the REPL we can run the application system with server, database and TailwindCSS components:

```shell
user=> (reset)
```

_TODO: add link to setup editor doc_

## Change starter page

Let's change something on the starter page and see the result. Open `src/myproject/views.clj` file
and replace ui component `:h1` to `[:h1 {:class ["text-4xl"]} "Hello world!"]`.
After reloading the page you will see that title has been changed on the web page.
