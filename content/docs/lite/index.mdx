description: Welcome to the Clojure Stack Lite template!
icon: Book
---

This template is designed to help you get started with Clojure in a simple Server-side Rendering (SSR) setup.
In few steps you will have a fully functional application that you can use as a starting point for your own projects.
The generated app will have sane defaults and minimum things configure,
but if you really want everything is customizable to meet your needs.

You will have convenient local development setup with one command to run and auto-reload all parts of the app.
Preconfigured CI/CD with Github Actions for checking code quality to each commit
and for deploying your app to production. In other words all is left to do after creating a project with this template
is writing your business logic without worrying too much about configuration and setup.

## Features

Few things that is worth highlighting about this template:

- 🏗️ Robust Clojure stack powered by Integrant and Reitit/Ring
- 🎨 Frontend using HTMX, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS v4
- 📦 Lightweight and fast SQLite database
- 🔄 Zero-downtime deployment via Kamal
- ⚡ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- 🧪 E2E and unit testing setup with coverage
- 🔍 Linting, formatting and deps version management
- 📱 Basic PWA support out of the box (without service worker)
- ⚙️ deps.edn and Babashka Tasks for efficient project management
