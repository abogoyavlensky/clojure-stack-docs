---

A modern, lightweight template for building server-side rendered Clojure applications with minimal configuration and maximum productivity.

This template empowers you to get started with Clojure in a simple Server-side Rendering (SSR) setup. In just one command, you'll have a fully functional application ready for development and production deployment.
The generated project comes with carefully selected defaults that balance simplicity with flexibility, while remaining fully customizable to meet your specific requirements.

## Why Choose Clojure Stack Lite?

- **Developer Experience First**: One command starts your entire development environment with auto-reload for backend code and styles.
- **Production Ready**: Includes CI/CD pipelines, deployment configurations, and some performance optimizations out of the box.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Leverage HTMX and AlpineJS for interactive UIs with option to add or replace anything
- **Focus on Your Business Logic**: Spend time building features, not configuring setup.

## Key features

- üèóÔ∏è Robust Clojure stack powered by Integrant and Reitit/Ring
- üé® Lightweight frontend using HTMX, AlpineJS and TailwindCSS v4
- üì¶ Lightweight and fast SQLite database
- üîÑ Zero-downtime deployment via Kamal
- ‚ö° GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
