title: App System
description: Application System configuration
---

The application is based on the [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) micro-framework to manage system state and dependencies.

## Configuration

The system is defined in the `resources/config.edn` file. We've extended the default configuration with the [Aero](https://github.com/juxt/aero) library, which adds useful reader tags to enhance EDN configuration. By default, our system config supports three profiles: `:test`, `:dev`, and `:prod`. You can extend these profiles according to your requirements.
As a shortcut for the config extension we use small helper library [`integrant-extras`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/integrant-extras) which provides a set of useful functions to read and manage the system configuration.

By default there are two components in the system: `:myproject.db/db` and `:myproject.server/server`.
The `db` component is responsible for managing the database connection pool, while the `server` component is responsible for starting the web server. You can add more components to the system as needed.
Each component pre-defined in the system comes with Malli schema for its arguments.

## Development

The main entry point for development is the `dev/user.clj` file. This file contains several useful functions to manage the application in the REPL. The most important function is `reset`:

```
(defn reset
  "Restart system."
  []
  (ig-repl/set-prep! #(ig-extras/read-config :dev "config.dev.edn"))
  (ig-repl/reset))
```

This function reads the system configuration and starts and restarts the system. We extend the default `config.edn` with the `config.dev.edn` file, which adds an extra component to start the Tailwind CSS watcher as part of the application system.

## Production

In production, the main entry point is `src/myproject/core.clj`. It contains a `-main` function that runs the system using [`integrant-extras.core/run-system`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/integrant-extras/blob/d075a98504199fb4c7830b1085b915d17109fdc3/src/integrant_extras/core.clj#L68-L75). This function is used when running the application from a JAR file.

The [`Slim`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/slim) library is used to build the JAR file. It's a wrapper around the `tools.build` library that simplifies the process of building JAR files. The configuration is defined in the `deps.edn` file under the `:build` alias. You can run the build with the following command:

```bash
bb build
```

This command will compile the output CSS file, hash static assets, create a `manifest.edn` file in the new `resources-hashed` directory, and build the JAR file.

## Logging

For logging we use combination of standard `org.clojure/tools.logging` and `ch.qos.logback/logback-classic`. You can find logging config at `resources/logback.xml`.
