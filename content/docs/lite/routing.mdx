## Routing

This project implements routing using Reitit with Ring and Malli for request validation. Reitit provides a powerful and flexible routing system for Clojure web applications. For comprehensive information about route syntax and capabilities, consult the [Reitit documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/reitit/0.8.0/doc/basics/route-syntax).

## Middlewares

The project comes pre-configured with several middlewares that enhance security and provide convenient functionality. These middlewares are defined in the [`reitit-extras`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/reitit-extras/blob/3d3152a0d332a7dce973f91c65f4f6471b8953c5/src/reitit_extras/core.clj#L173-L203) helper library.

You can easily extend the default middleware stack with your own custom middlewares by passing the `:middlewares` option to the first argument of `reitit-extras/get-handler-ssr` in the `src/myproject/server.clj` file.
