## Routing

For routing we use Reitit with Ring and Malli for validation. You consult [Reitit documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/reitit/0.8.0/doc/basics/route-syntax) for more details.


## Middlewares

The project includes a few middlewares for security and convenience, they are defined in the [`reitit-extras`](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/reitit-extras/blob/3d3152a0d332a7dce973f91c65f4f6471b8953c5/src/reitit_extras/core.clj#L173-L203) helper library.

You can also extend list of defaults middlewares with your own by passing `:middlewares` to the first argument of `reitit-extras/get-handler-ssr` at `src/myproject/server.cj` file.
