## Routing

This project implements routing using Reitit with Ring, and Malli for request validation. Reitit provides a powerful and flexible routing system for Clojure web applications. For comprehensive information about route syntax and capabilities, consult the [Reitit documentation](https://cljdoc.org/d/metosin/reitit/0.8.0/doc/basics/route-syntax).

The main file for server component is `src/myproject/server.clj`. It contains the main function that starts the server and initializes the routing system. The routing system is defined in the `routes` variable, which is a vector of routes.
Routes live in the `src/myproject/routes.clj` file for convenience.

## Middlewares

The project comes pre-configured with several middlewares that enhance security and provide convenient functionality.
Pre-configured middleware set based on the [ring-defaults](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-defaults).
You can easily extend the default middleware stack with your own custom middlewares in the `src/myproject/server.clj` file.
